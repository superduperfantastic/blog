<p>Hi, I’m Tinna (one 'n' is silent), but I sign my name as “Suki” all over the interwebs, including <a href="http://www.twitter.com/suki" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. By day, I am a number cruncher and master of Excel working for a social enterprise based in San Francisco. The rest of the time, I’m dreaming about my next travel destination or small house project.</p>

<p>I’m a native San Franciscan living with the boyfriend and our two animals in what I consider to be “home base,” despite its daily lessons on the <a href="/category/homeowners-journal/" title="Homeowner's Journal">joys of homeownership</a>.</p>
<p>I spend most weekends and any time off: volunteering, learning, <a href="/category/thirsty/">sipping tasty beverages</a>, getting outdoors, eating around the world and documenting <a href="/travel/">travels</a> and other adventures.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I had major <a href="/category/metal-mouth/">jaw surgery</a>. That journey’s documented on this blog as well!</p>
<p>I do supplement the cost of running this site with occasional ads, sponsored posts, and affiliate links. I always disclose a relationship if there is one. If you’re interested in working with me, please do reach out!</p>
