<p>Hi, we are Tinna (one 'n' is silent) and Ryan, and this is our about page! </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1939/45234306042_23d07bca48_b.jpg"></p>
<p>We live with our two animals in San Francisco in our "starter home," which in San Francisco prices is more like one's forever home. </p>
<h2>This is Tinna</h2>   
<p>She signs her name as “Suki” all over the interwebs, including <a href="http://www.twitter.com/suki" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. By day, she is a number cruncher and master of Excel, working for a social enterprise based in San Francisco. The rest of the time, she's dreaming about her next travel destination or small house project.</p>
<p>Spends most weekends and any time off: volunteering, learning, <a href="/category/thirsty/">sipping tasty beverages</a>, getting outdoors, eating around the world and documenting <a href="/travel/">travels</a> and other adventures.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, she had major <a href="/category/metal-mouth/">jaw surgery</a>. That journey’s documented on this blog as well!</p>

<h2>This is Ryan</h2>   
<p>"Not Brian!" He is his family's go-to IT support guy because of his affinity for computers since an early age. By day, he is a software engineer with a "design technologist" job title (whatever that means). The rest of the time, he's in front of the computer a lot too.</p>
<p>Spends most weekends and any time off: all of the above that Tinna lures him away from the computer with, building a <a href="https://housewolf.studio" target="_blank">VR game</a>, fishing, reading up on all things WWII and hanging out with the pup.</p>
