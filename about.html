<p>Hi, I’m Tinna, but I go by “Suki” all over the internet (and often times spilling into real life). By day, I am a numbers geek and master of Excel. The rest of the time, I’m dreaming about my next destination or small house project.</p>

<p>I’m a native San Franciscan living with the boyfriend and our two animals in a home I consider to be “home base,” even though it teaches me daily lessons on the <a href="/category/homeowners-journal/" title="Homeowner's Journal">joys of homeownership</a>.</p>
<p>I spend most weekends and any time off: volunteering, learning, sipping tasty beverages, getting outdoors, <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/category/hungry-suki/" target="_blank">eating</a> the world and documenting <a href="/travel/">travels</a> and other adventures.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I had major <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/jaw-surgery/">jaw surgery</a>. That journey’s documented on this blog as well!</p>
