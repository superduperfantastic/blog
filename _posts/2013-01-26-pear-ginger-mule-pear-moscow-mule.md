![Saturday Swig](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png){:.left} Since the first weekend of the new year, I've been going, going, going. This non-stop go-go-go attitude has left me drained and craving some R&R. After scurrying about town running errands that fell onto my plate less than 24 hours before, it was time to curl up on the couch with a cocktail. Ryan recently picked up a 6-pack of ginger beer for the house, so when I saw that there was only one left, I laid claim to it. Moscow Mule time!

![Saturday Swig - Pear Moscow Mule](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8495/8418792700_0e00c87ec6.jpg){:.left} I've recently been in touch with some fine folks at [The Perfect Purée of Napa Valley](http://perfectpuree.com/ "Perfect Puree"){:target="_blank"}, and they sent me some of their products to sample ~ one of which was the pear puree!

According to their Pear [profile sheet](http://www.perfectpuree.com/index.php/Products/pear.html?recipeId=4470 "Perfect Puree Pear"){:target="_blank"}, ginger is one of many complementary flavors. You see where I am going with this, don't you? This weekend's [Saturday Swig](http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/ "Saturday Swig"){:target="_blank"} - my Pear & Ginger Mule or Pear Moscow Mule. I'm no mixologist, so I gathered the ingredients, eyeballed the proportions and served the concoction up. I used one of the many [Can Can Cleanse](http://superduperfantastic.com/saturday-swig-3-can-can-cleanse/16118/ "Saturday Swig #3 - Can Can Cleanse"){:target="_blank"} jars that I've collected as my shaker ~ nothing fancy.

>
>1.5 oz The Perfect Purée of Napa Valley Pear, thawed  
>1.5 oz vodka  
>Ginger Beer (to taste)  
>Ice for the shaking

Simple, right? There are, of course, plenty of more elaborate recipes on The Perfect Puree website. The puree was incredibly easy to use. While I was running around town like a crazy chicken, it sat on the counter at home thawing. When I finally returned home, it was ready! I didn't have any limes sitting around the house, but even without one of the Moscow Mule's common ingredients, this drink is absolutely tasty. The pear puree added a delicate aroma and lovely texture. I could have added more vodka or less ginger beer to make it taste a little stronger, but overall, it was such a pleasant drink.
