![Saturday Swig](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png){:.left} This week's Saturday Swig is a root beer float! I skipped last week's [Saturday Swig](http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/ "Saturday Swig") post because I was having way too much fun at Disneyland! [Donna](http://donnasaur.us "Donnasaur"){:target="_blank"} [new domain!], Ryan and I drove down Friday evening. We spent only one day at the Disneyland parks [no California Adventure this time] because we would have to drive back Sunday. Rather than rushing back, we took our time and a longer route back passing through Santa Barbara - 101 rather than the 5\.

With the holiday the weekend before, Disneyland was more relaxing than any other time I've been there. We had quite a bit of time to roam from ride to ride. We made a stop at [The Golden Horseshoe Saloon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horseshoe_Revue#The_Golden_Horseshoe_Revue "The Golden Horseshoe Saloon"){:target="_blank"} in Frontierland when we spotted a sign for root beer floats! It was between 80 and 90 degrees out, so the break was definitely welcome.

### Root Beer Float Time!

Unfortunately, we made the root beer float break a little on the early side. We missed the shows that you'd normally find at the Golden Horseshoe since we didn't check our schedules until _after_ we'd already devoured the floats and made our way across the park. We'll have to time it better next time!
