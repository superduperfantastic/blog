![Welcome to Wyoming](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/241/459536490_829cb5940a_o.jpg)

I'm in Jackson, Wyoming.

The drive from Idaho Falls ("IF" according to the locals) was actually not bad - a quick 2-3 hours on a somewhat scenic road. I had a minor delay at a gas station on the way - couldn't quite figure out how to open the gas cap. Put aside my shy side and went to ask the station attendant. **Talk about embarrassing.** Freakin' rental cars! It's an SUV to boot. I'm accustomed to handling small cars, not huge SUVs. But hey, free upgrades are always welcome. I think they were out of intermediates.

Now why am I in Jackson?<a id="more"></a><a id="more-25"></a>

I didn't want to go home for the weekend, and there isn't much to do in IF, so I did a quick search to see what was nearby, and voila - the Jackson Hole area came up! I'm currently staying with K, a gal I met via Couchsurfing [Yes, I'm crazy like that]. Pretty lucky with the whole experience so far. K's very cool, and so are her friends. I'm having a blast! Went to a local hockey game last night with them, and then we headed over to the brewpub where a few of them work for some drinks afterwards. A most excellent time.

I tried to drive to [Yellowstone National Park](http://www.nps.gov/yell/), but it's supposed to be closed until a week or two into May. Slightly bummed out about that. No Old Faithful this time around. But on the drive up and down, I spent a bit of time in [Grand Teton National Park](http://www.nps.gov/grte/), stopping for photos along the road.
