I consider myself fairly lucky. My life isn't particularly stressful, or at least I try not to let it get to me too much. Sometimes those things that cause worry are unavoidable (like finances, health trouble, and work woes), but it's really all about how you let it (or NOT) affect you. Here are my five favorite ways for relieving stress (no particular order):

### 1) Gratitude

![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7605/16756465056_8e6d02060d_m.jpg){:.left} My top method for coping with a stressful circumstance is practicing gratitude. This little exercise can be done in a journal, out loud, or even just to yourself. It helps to take note of all the things that _are_ going your way in life. It puts into perspective all the stresses and also helps to determine whether or not something needs to change in order for it to stop stressing you out.

### 2) Massage

About four years ago, I found a massage therapist with a practice in my neighborhood. He was reasonably priced and accommodating with my schedule. Since then, I've gone in once every month and a half or two months for "maintenance."

I am a sucker for a good massage, however. Even between these massages, I sometimes "cheat" and find a cheap Chinese foot massage place where a foot massage is really a full body massage. My body feels wonderful, and the tension of the worries melt away.

### 3) Surrounding Yourself with Love (Animals Encouraged)

Love and animals! They love you no matter what. Somehow, they know when you're down and need a few extra snuggles. Definitely one of my favorite ways to cope with stress. They're particularly helpful for keeping you grounded in the here and now. Their only concerns are of the present, not the past or future.

### 4) Sleep

Super important and one that I easily take for granted. The more rested you are, the better you can function. Sleeping well can clear your mind of all the clutter that life brings.

### 5) Exercise

This one is new for me since I wasn't really _that_ into exercising before. BUT, I'm 100% behind it. Getting those endorphins from physical activity and sweating it out really helps in dealing with stress. If the gym or a fitness class isn't your thing, head outside for some fresh air. I recently joined [ClassPass](http://www.classpass.com/buynow?utm_content=11426165268 "ClassPass"){:target="_blank"}, and I love that I can try out different studios in the area.

### RESCUE Remedy

Stress is a normal part of life and a little bit is actually healthy. Having ways to deal is great, but sometimes I can't stop my day and hit the gym, schedule a massage appointment or get some extra sleep. That's when something like [RESCUE Remedy](http://clvr.li/1GcF5jS "RESCUE Remedy") can come in handy!
