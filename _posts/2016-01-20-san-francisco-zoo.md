Ryan and I kicked off the new year with a visit to the San Francisco Zoo. The 100 acres in the southwestern corner of the city is home to over 1,000 exotic, endangered and rescued animals representing more than 250 species. I bought a membership last year, thinking we would visit a few times during the year. It expires at the end of the month, and I've only gone once in the year.<!--more-->

In celebration of Penguin Awareness Day (January 20), here are some photos of the Magellanic penguins at the SF Zoo. It boasts the largest breeding colony of Magellanic penguins in captivity!
