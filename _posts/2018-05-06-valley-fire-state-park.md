Who else has this problem? Too many photos to process, so it takes awhile to even get to them. Don't even get me started on videos. At this rate, I'll be going through those in five more years. During this photo organization process, I came across these photos from our trip last April to [Valley of Fire State Park](http://parks.nv.gov/parks/valley-of-fire){:target="_blank"}. It was really a trip to Vegas for a friend's wedding, but this was definitely a highlight.

[Valley of Fire State Park](http://parks.nv.gov/parks/valley-of-fire){:target="_blank"} is the oldest of Nevada's state parks. From Vegas, we drove the hour out through what seemed like middle-of-nowhere, got to the entrance and then it more or less sprung on us! It was pretty spectacular, even.

_Desert Flora_  

Covering approximately 35,000 acres, we barely scratched the surface with our short visit. We, of course, swung by the visitor center to figure out which hikes we could fit in our limited amount of time in the area. There were a few spots we could drive by, and then the rest of our time would be dedicated to hiking to the Fire Wave and then the White Domes Loop. Both were under 1.5 miles long, so perfect for this quick jaunt of ours!

**Valley of Fire State Park - The Fire Wave**  

We like easy picturesque hikes, and this was definitely one of them. The ~1.2 miles in and out are marked by intermittent arrows, first across sand and then across the rocks. It was pretty user-friendly for these infrequent hikers.

**Valley of Fire State Park - White Domes Loop**  

When it comes to hiking, we also really love loops. White Domes is not only a loop, but it's an easy 1.2 mile trail with a lot to see. In that distance, we descended into the sand, ventured past an old movie set, hiked through a slot canyon, saw a natural arch and multicolored sandstone on the way back.

_Shots along the White Domes Loop_

It was warm during our visit last April. Even going such short distances with shade and a water bottle, we were quickly reminded that we could definitely have used more water on the trip. It's the desert, and you don't want to mess around. We took breaks when we needed them  - one of them was in the hole pictured above on the right. I was immediately drawn to climbing up into it because it was a purplish tint on the inside.

If I'm in Vegas with a rental car handy, I'd definitely try to make the trip out to Valley of Fire again. We're not usually the overnight backcountry camping types, but we could revisit these short hikes, do a longer hike or two, or maybe pick a different time of day to visit. The views in the early morning and early evening would probably yield the best display of colors!
