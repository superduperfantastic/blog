In the past, I've only posted spending summaries at the end of each year. What better way to stay accountable on "saving more" throughout the year than by looking at it quarter by quarter and making adjustments as I go?

Here's what the first quarter of the year looked like as a percentage of overall spending:

**Home/Utilities (26%)** - I've lumped two mortgages (one where I live and one rental property), utilities and home improvement into one category. Since interest on both loans is greater than what a savings account would earn, I'm committing to paying more on them this year. My tenant moved out in mid-February, so there were some additional expenses related to getting the rental property up and on the market again.

**Investing/Crowdfunding (21%)** - This category represents post-tax savings, investing and in some cases, crowdfunding. It's the bucket of money that will most likely shift to the first category as I'm paying more. In the first quarter, I supported some friends who are opening up [a wine bar in Brooklyn](https://www.nextseed.com/offerings/california-88/){:target="_blank"}. They are crowdfunding to raise funds that they'll need to get their business off the ground. 

**Fitness (11%)** - As mentioned the other day, we're paying a little more attention on our health. This will go down when we've weaned ourselves from our amazing personal trainer. 

**Food/Bev (9%)** - We found a local sushi spot we really loved and tried to make it our regular spot. That meant spending money eating out. We are slowly shifting it back to eating in when we can. We do most of our grocery shopping at Costco and periodic farm boxes, both which yield large quantities of produce that must be eaten or processed quickly. We replaced our broken chest freezer and vacuum sealer, so now we're back to meal prepping a ton to freeze and eat later.

**Entertainment (8%)** - The bulk of this expense can be summed up in two big purchases we made in the first quarter: Legos and Broadway musicals. I would expect this to go down in subsequent quarters since we paid upfront. 

**Transportation (8%)** - In February, someone rear-ended us and did way more damage on the car than we originally thought. It took nearly a month to get our car back. We're paying our car loan each month as well. The interest rate is fairly low, so we're just paying that on a monthly basis for the duration of the loan. We had a parking spot downtown when Ryan could bring the dog to work, but by mid-March, we had switched over to commuting in by bus since Fresca isn't allowed at Ryan's new office.

**Travel (8%)** - Disneyland is included in this category, but the bulk of my spending was stocking up on gift cards for future travel use (examples - Airbnb, Hotels.com, Uber). Since I know that we will be traveling in the future, whenever I see gift cards on sale (usually for 3% or more off), I'll buy some and pay for the cost upfront. The site I use is: [Raise.com](https://geta.raise.com/tho222){:target="_blank"}. If you use my referral link, we will both get $5 off when you make a purchase within 30 days of signing up.

In terms of the income side of things, we had a few bursts of extra cash in the first quarter. In January and then in March, Ryan got bonuses. As soon as I could, I filed my taxes and got a nice return. I'm paid every two weeks, and in March, had an extra pay period - WOOOO! As mentioned earlier, it was a low rental income quarter while the rental property got fixed up for the next tenant.
