In the past, I've only posted spending summaries at the end of each year. What better way to stay accountable on "saving more" throughout the year than by looking at it quarter by quarter and making adjustments as I go?

Here's what the first quarter of the year looked like:

![Q1-2018 Spending](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/967/26794693327_787ba3d73d.jpg)

**Home/Utilities (26%)** - . 

**Investing/Crowdfunding (21%)** - This category represents post-tax saving, investing and in some cases, crowdfunding. Friends are starting a business and using crowdfunding to raise funds that they'll need to get their business off the ground.  

**Fitness (11%)** - Ryan and I have been going to a personal trainer since November. It was a pretty big commitment and investment - about 10% of our spending each month. While I was doing the occasional ClassPass, Ryan's only workout was taking the dog out. The few times I'd try to get him to a class with me, his body would not react well, so we decided personal attention would likely suit us best - at least in the beginning. 

**Food/Bev (9%)** - I've always been an advocate of spending many of my waking hours giving back. Luckily for me, my company values community and philanthropy. I was about to go into detail on the various organizations I'm involved with, but I think I'll save it for another post. Gotta create content where I can!

**Entertainment (8%)** - We decided to become Annual Passholders over the holidays, and so far we've more than made up the cost of the ticket. Long trips were out of the question earlier in the year due to a few things coming up at work, so I knew Disneyland would make for great weekend breaks. We can hop around the parks at a leisurely pace each time. So far, we've gone in December, January, March, and we'll go twice in April! 

**Transportation (8%)** - I reapplied for a library card at my local library, so that I could access their e-books. I've noticed that I seem to be a fan of the memoirs, so if you have any to suggest, I'm all ears!

**Travel (8%)** - I reapplied for a library card at my local library, so that I could access their e-books. I've noticed that I seem to be a fan of the memoirs, so if you have any to suggest, I'm all ears!

**Animals (3%)** - I know, I know. All this talk about what we're spending on... I promise you that most of the time, I'm sitting there staring at my budget in YNAB, trying to figure out how to keep it all together and how to pay more on debt since savings interest is pretty low. Work promotions and bonuses have certainly helped with being more comfortable with where we are financially, but it doesn't mean we are spending it left and right. We're making intentional purchasing decisions based on what we've prioritized for ourselves (definitely a privilege I don't take for granted). 

**Clothing (3%)**

**Gifts (2%)**

**Charity (1%)**
