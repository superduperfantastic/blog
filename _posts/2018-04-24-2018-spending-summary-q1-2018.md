In the past, I've only posted spending summaries at the end of each year. What better way to stay accountable on "saving more" throughout the year than by looking at it quarter by quarter and making adjustments as I go?

Here's what the first quarter of the year looked like as a percentage of overall spending:

![Q1-2018 Spending](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/967/26794693327_787ba3d73d.jpg)


**Home/Utilities (26%)** - I've lumped mortgage, utilities and home improvement into one category. Since interest on the mortgage is greater than what a savings account would earn, I'm committing to paying more on it this year. I'm expecting this number to go up, and in the future might even split out utilities and home improvements. 

**Investing/Crowdfunding (21%)** - This category represents post-tax saving, investing and in some cases, crowdfunding. Friends are opening up [a wine bar in Brooklyn](https://www.nextseed.com/offerings/california-88/){:target="_blank"} and using crowdfunding to raise funds that they'll need to get their business off the ground. 

**Fitness (11%)** - As mentioned the other day, we're paying a little more attention on our health. This will go down when we've weaned ourselves from our amazing personal trainer. 

**Food/Bev (9%)** - We found a local sushi spot we really loved and tried to make it our regular spot. That meant spending money eating out. We are slowly shifting it back to eating in when we can. We do most of our grocery shopping at Costco and periodic farm boxes, both which yield large quantities of produce that must be eaten or processed quickly. We replaced our broken chest freezer and vacuum sealer, so now we're back to meal prepping a ton to freeze and eat later.

**Entertainment (8%)** - The bulk of this expense can be summed up in two big purchases we made in the first quarter: Legos and Broadway musicals. I would expect this to go down in subsequent quarters since we paid upfront. 

**Transportation (8%)** - Most of this is the auto loan, but in February, someone rear-ended us and did way more damage on the car than we originally thought. It took nearly a month to get our car back. We also had a parking spot we were renting in the beginning of the year. We were saving on doggie daycare since Ryan could bring the dog to work, but we compromised by finding a spot downtown that we could drive to. By mid-March, we had switched over to commuting in by bus since Fresca isn't allowed at Ryan's new office.

**Travel (8%)** - Disneyland is included in this category, but the bulk of my spending was stocking up on gift cards for future travel use (examples - Airbnb, Hotels.com, Uber). Since I know that we will be traveling in the future, whenever I see gift cards on sale (usually for 3% or more off), I'll buy some and pay for the cost upfront. The site I use is: [Raise.com](https://geta.raise.com/tho222){:target="_blank"}. If you use my referral link, we will both get $5 off when you make a purchase within 30 days of signing up.

**Animals (3%)** - Most of this is doggie daycare. With Ryan's new job, Fresca will be at daycare more often since we want to keep her active during the day and socializing with other people/pups.  

**Clothing (3%)** - Rather than shop for new clothes, I maintain Rent the Runway and Le Tote subscriptions. That's normally around $200 a month if I don't pause my Le Tote. In the first quarter, we also bought some workout clothes and a suit for Ryan.
