_Autumn leaves and the sky at twilight in Geyserville_

**1. Blog every day in November.** 

>It's NaBloPoMo (**Na**tional **Blo**g **Po**sting **Mo**nth). Thanks [San](http://www.theinbetweenismine.com/){:target="_blank"} for getting us back on track with blogging! 

>With Ryan's help, I am going to blog every day in November. One of the hardest things about writing every day is coming up with what to blog about, so I'll likely bring back some of the prompts I've used in the past or seek inspiration elsewhere. While I might not post on a timely basis, I will have one post for each day! At least that's the goal...

**2. Vote.**

> One of the _most_ important things we can do right now is vote! We get our ballot by mail, fill them out and turn them into the local polling place on Election Day. We will do the same this year!

**3. Reorganize the wardrobe - get rid of clothing.**  

> Getting rid of the excess in our home is an ongoing project. Next on my list is clothing. I'd really like to do a wardrobe overhaul, maybe even a capsule for work clothes. We're making piles of donation items and bringing them to the Goodwill periodically. We have a Goodwill run scheduled for today since we gathered a bunch of things during our [living room refresh](/2018-living-room-refresh-budget){:target="_blank"}. 

>This goal might move into December and January, but I'm already thinking about which items I don't fit or like to wear anymore.

**4. Complete our online ePadi training.**

> In a few weeks, we are heading to Belize, and part of our trip itinerary is a marine conservation diving experience with [Reef Conservation International](https://reefci.com/){:target="_blank"}. We will learn to dive and help protect the ocean at the same time. Reef Conservation International's mission is to protect our oceans through science, action, and advocacy through ongoing conservation programs, education, and marine research. To make the most of our time while on their little island, they encourage participants to do the online ePadi training, so that's what we'll be working on before the trip!

**5. Go natural.**  

> This one is probably TMI, but I have wanted to switch to more natural products, including deodorants. I've tried to do this before, but then I couldn't stand the adjustment period where everything gets worse before it gets better. I'm determined to get through it this time. Sorry to all those who are physically around me while I go through my "stinky kid in class" phase! 

**What are your goals for November?**
