  content: I took that drive a few years ago. Gorgeous park! We're lucky to have so
    many wonderful national parks in the U.S. Just not enough time to visit them all.

  content: I agree. I feel so lucky that we've actually preserved these places as
    national parks and monuments, so that we could actually visit them!

  content: Colorado was amazing, but the altitude is definitely a reality. Copper
    was at 9,000 feet and the first day everything felt really, really difficult.
    The key is to drink A LOT of water, but that means bathroom breaks happen every
    hour or so and when you're driving that's REALLY difficult. I want to go back
    to Colorado and drive around and just experience more of it. It's a beautiful
    place.

    is incredible and Este''s Park has a lot of great eateries. If you make it back
    to Colorado, check out Mt. Evan''s as well. '

    it over the course of the week. Kinda crazy how a week still isn''t enough time
    to do it all! :P '

  content: I'd never been more hydrated in my life. The best part was that everywhere
    you went, water was readily available. Here, you have to fight your way through
    the crowds to ask the bartender for water. It should be RIGHT THERE.

  content: I think they know they've got to have water available up there, otherwise
    people just die. At Wanderlust, there were these super cool "Hydration Stations"
    that were crafted by some woodworker and sponsored by CamelBak - it was super
    cool and super easy to get water whenever you needed it with those things all
    around.

<p>Ever since Ryan and I picked up one of those <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.eparks.com&#47;store&#47;product&#47;22515&#47;*Passport%C2%AE-To-Your-National-Parks*&#47;" target="_blank">Passports To Your National Parks<&#47;a>, we have made it a point to visit national parks whenever we can squeeze in a trip. On our recent trip to Colorado, we paid a visit to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nps.gov&#47;romo&#47;index.htm" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain National Park<&#47;a>. With a handful of hours to spend in the park, as well as a bit of uneasiness due to the altitude, we decided to drive along Rocky Mountain National Park's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nps.gov&#47;romo&#47;planyourvisit&#47;trail_ridge_road.htm" title="Rocky Mountain National Park - Trail Ridge Road" target="_blank">Trail Ridge Road<&#47;a>, the <strong>highest continuously paved road in America<&#47;strong>! </p>
<p>It is a stretch of U.S. Highway 34 that traverses the national park from Estes Park to Grand Lake [east to west]. This Scenic and Historic Byway [one of 25 in Colorado] runs 48 miles through the park from east to west, and ranges in elevation from 8,000 feet to over 12,000 feet. As one can imagine, the views were incredible and expansive. Photos hardly do it justice; it isn't easy to capture <strong>majestic<&#47;strong>. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;farm9.staticflickr.com&#47;8163&#47;7499418122_8f74954615_c.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park - Trail Ridge Road" &#47;><&#47;p><br />
We even caught a glimpse of the smoke billowing from the fires up north. I hadn't realized just how big&#47;close the fires were. </p>
<p>Eleven miles of the road bring you above tree line in the alpine tundra. The road reaches a maximum elevation of 12,183 feet near Fall River Pass. The life and climatic conditions are similar to that found at the Arctic Circle. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;farm9.staticflickr.com&#47;8014&#47;7499425124_4373abd1ef.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park - Trail Ridge Road" width="350" &#47;> <img src="http:&#47;&#47;farm9.staticflickr.com&#47;8291&#47;7499428800_de37c237a8.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park - Trail Ridge Road" width="350" &#47;><&#47;p>

At 11,796 feet is the Alpine Visitor Center. It's the highest facility of its kind in the National Park Service!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;farm8.staticflickr.com&#47;7278&#47;7499433202_6cc884354a_z.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park - Trail Ridge Road" &#47;><&#47;p><br />
Once you hit the highest point, it is mostly downhill from there. The road crosses the Continental Divide at Milner Pass [10,758 feet] where drainage to the Pacific and to the Atlantic go their separate ways. </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;farm9.staticflickr.com&#47;8148&#47;7499438916_255fb70a8c.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park - continental divide" width="350" &#47;> <img src="http:&#47;&#47;farm9.staticflickr.com&#47;8028&#47;7499445176_62ed1e2533.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park - continental divide" width="350" &#47;><&#47;p><br />
We took a quick lunch and photo break before continuing on to Holzwarth Historic Site, a former dude ranch where guests paid two dollars a day or eleven dollars a week for room and board. Of course, this was in the 30s! What was only supposed to be a quick stroll from the car ended up being an informative afternoon of learning about the ranch and its former inhabitants, and just chatting it up with park volunteers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;farm9.staticflickr.com&#47;8291&#47;7499355756_e9ab1a1635_c.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park - Holzwarth Historic Site" &#47;><&#47;p><br />
In about a handful of hours, we made our way from Estes Park down to Grand Lake on Trail Ridge Road. If we'd had more time, I'd like to say that we would have gone on a few short hikes, but that'd probably be a lie because the elevation was definitely affecting us. Who knows what we would have been up to? More driving around? We never spend enough time visiting national parks; it's always just a taste!</p>
<p><strong>If you <em>ever<&#47;em> find yourself in a national park, get yourself on the tours to make the most of your experience!<&#47;strong> They are usually FREE, led by rangers or park volunteers and full of the most interesting stories&#47;info. The tour of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;superduperfantastic.com&#47;boston-2011-uss-cassin-young&#47;12528&#47;" title="Boston 2011 &ndash; USS Cassin Young">USS Cassin Young<&#47;a> when we were in Boston last year was one of our trip highlights.</p>
