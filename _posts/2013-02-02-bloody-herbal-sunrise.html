<img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png" alt="Saturday Swig" class="alignleft" />Now that it seems pretty obvious to me that I have given up my <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/wine-and-love-2/" title="Wine and Love">Wine and Love</a> posts, I will be more diligent about the other regular feature on this site - <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/" title="Saturday Swig" target="_blank">Saturday Swig</a>. This week, I am featuring an adapted version of a recipe from <a href="http://www.perfectpuree.com/index.php/Products/thyme-a-citrus.html?recipeId=4666" title="Perfect Puree" target="_blank">The Perfect Pur&eacute;e of Napa Valley</a> website - the Herbal Sunrise. </p>
<p>Instead of using Tito's Handmade Vodka per the recipe, I used SKYY Infusions Blood Orange vodka and added "Bloody" to the name. It tastes better than the name sounds, resembling a strawberry lemonade that kicks your socks right off! These days, I need something like this Bloody Herbal Sunrise to kick me in the face in the most tasty way. </p>
<h3><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8324/8440772970_00e6e2f40a_n.jpg" class="alignright" alt="Bloody Herbal Sunrise" />Bloody Herbal Sunrise (Strawberry "Lemonade")</h3><br />
1 oz <em>The Perfect Pur&eacute;e of Napa Valley</em> Thyme & Citrus, thawed<br />
0.75 oz <em>The Perfect Pur&eacute;e of Napa Valley</em> Strawberry, thawed<br />
1.5 oz <em>SKYY</em> Infusions ~ Blood Orange vodka<br />
Ginger Beer (to taste)<br />
Ice for the shaking</p>
<p>As I've been doing for most of our cocktail making recently, I put everything into a jar for a shaking or two and then served it up. I'm not one for <em>precise</em> measurements ~ eyeballing it seems to work for me. The first time I made this, I must have been a little heavy handed with the vodka because it was quite strong. Flavor-wise, the blood orange flavor really added to the citrus of the puree. The second time, I used more ginger beer for a more refreshing "lemonade." Both versions got the thumbs up, so that's a good sign.</p>
<p>More info on the two flavors:<br />

<blockquote><p><strong>The Perfect Pur&eacute;e of Napa Valley</strong> is the leading U.S. producer of premium fruit and vegetable purees and concentrates.

All purees and concentrates are natural and contain no artificial additives, preservatives or colorings.

<em>Disclosure: While <a href="http://perfectpuree.com/" title="Perfect Puree" target="_blank">The Perfect Pur&eacute;e of Napa Valley</a> sent me samples of puree, I was not compensated for this post. All fresh fruit puree-loving opinions are my own.</em></p>
