<strong>Friday, November 6</strong> - DAY SIX</p>
<p><u>MORNING:</u> Start your day with green smoothies with your Airbnb hosts. Take their advice and opt out of possibly encountering Friday traffic. Ride Ecobicis to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/IVOIRE-Reatauranteur-Polanco/133780070123919" target="_blank">Ivoire</a>, a restaurant recommended by your host. Ride Ecobicis to <a href="http://www.sedema.df.gob.mx/bosquedechapultepec/" target="_blank">Bosque de Chapultepec</a>. Walk up to and stroll through <a href="http://castillodechapultepec.inah.gob.mx/" target="_blank">Castillo de Chapultepec</a>. Snap pictures of the grounds and the city below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1530/24433980813_416d728444_c.jpg" alt="Mexico City - Chapultepec" /></p><br />
<img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5791/23160149480_36c1fe0365_n.jpg" class="alignright" /><u>AFTERNOON:</u> Walk to <a href="http://museotamayo.org/restaurante" target="_blank">Museo Tamayo</a> for drinks. Laugh along with the hostess when she mistakens Ryan's request for <em>bebidas</em> ("drinks") as one for <em>pepitas</em> ("pumpkin seeds"). After drinks at the museum cafe, make note of Museo Tamayo for the next visit. Ride Ecobicis to <a href="http://laciudadela.com.mx/" target="_blank">La Ciudadela</a>. Wander around the stalls to check out the crafts.</p>
<p><u>EVENING:</u> Uber home to change and head out to dinner at <a href="http://www.pujol.com.mx/" target="_blank">Pujol</a>, one of <a href="http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/Pujol" target="_blank">The World's 50 Best Restaurants</a>. Hem and haw over what to choose from the menu. While it's a prix fixe menu, you do have to choose between a few items in several categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1525/24132390672_c3f7220af0_c.jpg" alt="Pujol" /></p><br />
Since you've said "Yes" to your Airbnb's host's invitation to see Lo Fang at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tabernalucerna34/timeline#_=_" target="_blank">Luciferina</a>, put your full and happy bellies in an Uber to the venue. Pay more for the show than many things you've paid for in Mexico City. Spend the evening dodging cigarette smoke since the show is on a rooftop. Grab tacos after the show at <a href="http://tacoselfarolito.com.mx/" target="_blank">El Farolito</a> in Polanco.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday, November 7</strong> - DAY SEVEN</p>
<p><u>MORNING:</u> Get up bright and early. Take an Uber to <a href="http://www.museodoloresolmedo.org.mx/" target="_blank">Museo Dolores Olmedo</a> in Xochimilco. It's one of the longer Uber rides you will take during your stay, but it's still under $12. Like the other museums, buy a photography pass for each person taking photos. Check out the exhibits of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo's work. Wander the lovely grounds of the estate. Eat a late breakfast in the museum.</p>

<u>AFTERNOON:</u> Take an Uber to check out the canals of Xochimilco. Accidentally get talked onto a boat in your very broken Spanish, but manage to finally get off the boat and walk away as you try to explain that you don't want to spend the next few hours on the water. Note that there's some leeway in the price as they offer you one last price for the ride that you just don't want to commit to taking this time around. Walk around and take some photos before heading out of the area.</p>

<u>EVENING:</u> Uber to the Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico ("UNAM"). Grab a bite on campus at the restaurant on the bottom level of <a href="http://muac.unam.mx/" target="_blank">Museo Universitario Arte Contemporaneo</a> ("MUAC") because it seems that somewhere during the day, lunch was forgotten, and it's already dinner time. After dinner, explore the interactive exhibits at MUAC until closing.  </p>

<h3>Mexico City - Real Talk</h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit <a href="http://museotamayo.org/" target="_blank">Museo Tamayo</a> for contemporary and modern art. We didn't get a chance to this time, but we definitely will if we're in Mexico City again.</li></p>
<li>Eat at <a href="http://www.pujol.com.mx/" target="_blank">Pujol</a>. For being one of the top restaurants, I was surprised to make a reservation without too much trouble. Get there right on time because they won't let you in early. They'll send you to their sister restaurant/cafe next door.</li>
<li>If you're a fan of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo's work, <a href="http://www.museodoloresolmedo.org.mx/" target="_blank">Museo Dolores Olmedo</a> is worth the trek to Xochimilco. In addition to the regular exhibits, there are some special exhibits that come through as well. While we were visiting, the exhibits were Dia de los Muertos themed.</li>
<li>While we didn't hop on a boat ("<em>trajinera</em>") ride, we wouldn't hesitate to if we were in a larger group and if we had preparations for a picnic. That way, the cost of the boat is divided among more people, and we aren't buying food and drinks on the spot.</li>
<li>Visit <a href="http://muac.unam.mx/" target="_blank">MUAC</a> for some interactive exhibits and an inexpensive meal at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NubeSiete" target="_blank">Nube Siete</a>. Enjoy a beverage if there's a wait for your table.</li><br />
</ul></p>
