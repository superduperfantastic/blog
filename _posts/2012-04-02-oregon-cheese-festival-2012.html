    obsessed with trying to make it. I hear mozzarella is a good first cheese to make
    as it's maybe the easiest of the easy.&nbsp;

  content: I heard pulling mozzarella wasn't that easy, but it's considered an easy
    cheese because you don't need cultures to make it, and you really want to eat
    it fresh. :) The chive cheese and goat cheese Ryan made recently were super easy.
    You separate the curds from the whey and knead in the herbs you want to flavor
    your cheese with!

<p>Here's how we ended up making the trek up to Central Point, Oregon for the Oregon Cheese Festival! Ryan and I had met Rod Volbeda of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wvcheeseco.com&#47;" title="Willamette Valley Cheese" target="_blank">Willamette Valley Cheese Company<&#47;a> and Francis Plowman of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.roguecreamery.com&#47;" title="Rogue Creamery" target="_blank">Rogue Creamery<&#47;a> at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;foodfete.com&#47;" title="Food Fete" target="_blank">Food Fete<&#47;a> in January. Over nibbles of Oregon cheese, they had casually invited us up to Southern Oregon for the festival. They probably don't even remember the conversation, but being a woman of my word and mostly just adventurous, I <em>had<&#47;em> to make it happen. </p>
<p>The cheese festival is a one-day event in a tent set up next to Rogue Creamery. This year's event took place a few Saturdays ago on St. Patrick's Day. Included in the admission price of $15 was a marketplace for sampling cheese and other goodies. For $5 more, we received a glass for tastings of beer&#47;wine. I really enjoyed the farmer's market format, which allowed for direct interaction at each of the tables. Even with the crowds, it never got so bad that I didn't feel like I couldn't chat with the vendors.</p>

<p>Aside from the array of delicious cheeses we tasted and the libations that paired so nicely with them, the highlight of the festival was really the two classes that we attended - <em>Elementary Cheesemaking<&#47;em> with Margo True of Sunset Magazine and <em>Tasty Beers & Fabulous Cheeses<&#47;em> with Ginger Johnson of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;womenenjoyingbeer.com&#47;" title="Women Enjoying Beer" target="_blank">Women Enjoying Beer<&#47;a>. Both of the sessions were incredibly interesting and entertaining, <em>AND<&#47;em> they were free! It was a good thing we signed up early because the classes were pretty full. </p>

<em>David Gremmels, President&#47;Cheesemaker of Rogue Creamery, helping Margo with her demonstration.<&#47;em></p>
<p>In Margo True's class, we learned how <strong>SIMPLE<&#47;strong> making cheeses can be. You really just have to get a dairy thermometer and get started! We learned how to make Fresh Chive Cheese, Ricotta, and Fromage Blanc. It was really neat watching the cheesemaking right before our very eyes. </p>

Here are the cheeses that we had a chance to taste at the end of the class. Ryan was so inspired by the class that he's already planning out his first batch of cheese. I'll be sure to document how that goes!</p>

<strong>Tasty Beers & Fabulous Cheeses<&#47;strong></p>
<p>The second class was the first of its kind at the Oregon Cheese Festival! The beer and cheese pairing&#47;tasting was led by Ginger Johnson of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;womenenjoyingbeer.com&#47;" title="Women Enjoying Beer" target="_blank">Women Enjoying Beer<&#47;a>, a business dedicated to beer education, especially among females. She is freakin' amazing and incredibly animated. Exhibit A.</p>

Beer enthusiasm - that's what it's about. The class focused on pair four different cheeses with local Oregon brews. </p>

Back on the marketplace floor, here were some of my favorite <em>non-cheese<&#47;em> vendors:</p>

It was exciting to see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.garywest.com&#47;" target="_blank">Gary West Smoked Meats<&#47;a> at the show. They are local to the Southern Oregon [not too far away from the cheese festival], and their elk strips won a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.goodfoodawards.org&#47;" target="_blank">Good Food Award<&#47;a> this year!</p>

Jamie Rear of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zellafoods.com&#47;" title="Zella Foods" target="_blank">Zella Foods<&#47;a> chatted it up with us on hazelnuts and her life growing up on a hazelnut orchard. No going out to movies with friends when there's work to be done in the orchard! If she would let me, I'd love to visit and check out the harvest that she'd described. </p>

Louis Jeandin of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mushroomsallyear.com&#47;" target="_blank">Mushrooms All Year<&#47;a> was on hand to chat about his gorgeous display of local mushrooms. We also sampled some truffle butter!</p>

Unfortunately, I wasn't diligent about taking photos of <strong>EVERYTHING<&#47;strong>. Some of the great stuff I missed, but must recommend: Hot Lips Soda via <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oregonartisanfoods.com&#47;" target="_blank">Oregon Artisan Foods<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wanderingaengus.com&#47;" title="Wandering Aengus Ciderworks" target="_blank">Wandering Aengus Ciderworks<&#47;a>. Since <a href="http:&#47;&#47;superduperfantastic.com&#47;going-local-boston-local-food-fest-2011&#47;12240&#47;" title="Going Local &ndash; Boston Local Food Fest 2011">Boston Local Food Festival<&#47;a>, I've been pining for a dry cider to match the ones at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.povertylaneorchards.com&#47;farnum-hill-ciders&#47;" target="_blank">Farnum Hill Ciders<&#47;a>. I think I've found it! </p>
<p>With all the local cheese, beer&#47;wine&#47;cider, and other foods, Oregon Cheese Festival was quite the experience. Definitely worth the drive and short weekend trip!</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider making cheese if you knew how easy it can be? What kinds of cheese would you try making [regardless of difficulty level]?<&#47;strong></p>
