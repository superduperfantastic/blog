![Saturday Swig](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png){:.left} Now that it seems pretty obvious to me that I have given up my [Wine and Love](http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/wine-and-love-2/ "Wine and Love"){:target="_blank"} posts, I will be more diligent about the other regular feature on this site - [Saturday Swig](http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/ "Saturday Swig"){:target="_blank"}. This week, I am featuring an adapted version of a recipe from [The Perfect Purée of Napa Valley](http://www.perfectpuree.com/index.php/Products/thyme-a-citrus.html?recipeId=4666 "Perfect Puree"){:target="_blank"} website - the Herbal Sunrise.

Instead of using Tito's Handmade Vodka per the recipe, I used SKYY Infusions Blood Orange vodka and added "Bloody" to the name. It tastes better than the name sounds, resembling a strawberry lemonade that kicks your socks right off! These days, I need something like this Bloody Herbal Sunrise to kick me in the face in the most tasty way.

><h3>Bloody Herbal Sunrise (Strawberry "Lemonade")</h3>
>
>1 oz _The Perfect Purée of Napa Valley_ Thyme & Citrus, thawed  
>0.75 oz _The Perfect Purée of Napa Valley_ Strawberry, thawed  
>1.5 oz _SKYY_ Infusions ~ Blood Orange vodka  
>Ginger Beer (to taste)  
>Ice for the shaking

As I've been doing for most of our cocktail making recently, I put everything into a jar for a shaking or two and then served it up. I'm not one for _precise_ measurements ~ eyeballing it seems to work for me. The first time I made this, I must have been a little heavy handed with the vodka because it was quite strong. Flavor-wise, the blood orange flavor really added to the citrus of the puree. The second time, I used more ginger beer for a more refreshing "lemonade." Both versions got the thumbs up, so that's a good sign.

More info on the two flavors:
