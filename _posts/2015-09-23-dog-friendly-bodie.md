Whenever possible, taking trips where we can be dog-inclusive takes priority if we are planning on driving! Not only do we get to spend more time with our pup, we also save money on doggie daycare. However, it's more for the first reason than the second because many hotels charge an additional fee for pets, so money isn't really the issue at that point. 

While reading up on Bodie State Historic Park earlier in the year, we saw that leashed dogs are welcome so we included our pup in our trip planning!

*Fresca enjoying the views near the campground*

We picked out <a href="http://paradiseshoresrvpark.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradise Shores</a>, a dog-friendly campground (doggie shower and play area included!) in nearby Bridgeport. They love dogs and don't charge extra for them!

The elevation must have gotten to Fresca because when we were trying to set up our tent in super windy conditions, she just sat there patiently waiting rather than getting all up in our business. The elevation only bothered me on our second day as we were on our way home.
  
Once we were all set up and finished with traipsing through <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/see-bodie-california-ghost-town-at-night/23822/">Bodie at night</a>, she crossed "spend a night in a tent" off her bucket list (because of course she would have one)!

Dogs are welcome at Bodie State Historic Park as long as they are on leash and their owners pick up after them. There are a few buildings that they are not allowed to enter, such as the museum and the stamp mill, but that's fewer than a handful. It makes sense since there are artifacts on display and interiors in "arrested decay" being preserved.

Fresca enjoyed the sights and smells and didn't seem turned off by the ghosts. A few wild animals did catch her nose a few times, and she was tempted to run after what was rustling in the shrubs. Thankfully, she was mostly well-behaved and cooperated with us on our photo shoots.

Maintaining your pup's routines when on the road can be challenging. It's not easy communicating to the pup that we're just going to be taking a trip for a few days. The comforts of home aren't too far away. We are incredibly blessed that Fresca is flexible in terms of being able to travel with us. She adjusts and adapts to new environments because we take the time to familiarize her with new surroundings. We also try to bring some comforts of home along, like a favorite blanket, toy, and of course, her favorite - food and snacks!
