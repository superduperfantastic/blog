    way to garnish your drink! We rang in the new year very low key: just me, the
    hubs and dog. It was perfect!'

    How pretty! That's a really fun photo. We rang in the new year sick at home, hanging out on the couch watching season two of Parks and Rec. It was low key, but quite fun!

    Happy 2013!

  content: we were going to have game night at a friend's place. however, too many
    people showed up and it ended up just being a regular cocktail party (black and
    white). Still fun! It was the least amount of money  and prep I have spent on
    NYE.

  content: Very pretty idea! I've seen the white tea flowers but not that! Oh, and
    we spent the night at home trying to calm Posey who was barking nonstop and quivering
    in fear (11pm-2:30 am) because of the idiots setting off firecrackers in our neighborhood.
    We're retreating to the wilderness (with dog) for NYE next year!

  content: So pretty! We had people over, played Cards Against Humanity, drank lots
    and lots, then shouted and cheered as the ball dropped. Andrew also used a saber
    to open a few bottles of champagne, which was pretty epic.

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png" alt="Saturday Swig" class="alignleft" />Champagne and sparkles are synonymous with New Year's Eve celebrations. This week's <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/" title="Saturday Swig" target="_blank">Saturday Swig</a> is all about our New Year's bubbly! More specifically, what went into our bubbly - Wild Hibiscus in Syrup! </p>
<p>For the holidays, we were gifted with two jars of <a href="http://www.wildhibiscus.com/index.html" title="Wild Hibiscus" target="_blank">Wild Hibiscus in Syrup</a> - one in plain syrup and the other in rose syrup. What a brilliant gift idea, by the way! They are as their name describes - Wild Hibiscus flowers in syrup. All you have to do is put a flower in your glass and add a little syrup for flavoring if you want to. That's it! The flowers are edible, and based on the two that I've had, they're quite tasty.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8188/8360738380_2d88c050be_n.jpg" class="alignright" alt="Wild Hibiscus">Instead of consuming both jars of flowers on our own, we shared them with friends at their New Year's Eve party. The flowers were a hit and a great way to add some fun to our flutes. </p>
<p>Plus, they made for a great photo (photo credit: our awesome friend, Josh)! </p>
<p>I am definitely considering ordering these for future parties because I like them that much. In case you're looking for these Wild Hibiscus flowers, you can find them on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Hibiscus-Flowers-in-Syrup/dp/B002JKUVG2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1357535613&sr=8-1&keywords=wild+hibiscus+flowers+in+syrup" title="Wild Hibiscus Flowers in Syrup - Amazon" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>We spent the last few hours of 2012 mingling, eating and drinking. Some of our friends had left the party to do their own thing for a bit, but they returned at around 11:55 - just in time for the countdown! We grabbed our glasses, ran up to the rooftop, and watched the fireworks across the city as the clock struck midnight. And that was how we wrapped up 2012 and rang in 2013! </p>
<p><strong>How did you say goodbye to 2012 and hello to 2013?</strong> </p>
