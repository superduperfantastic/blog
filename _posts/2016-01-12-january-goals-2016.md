Happy 2016! This year, in place of "Currently" posts, I have "Goals" posts. I know we're already almost in the middle of the month, but here are my goals for January:

**Code for 10-15 minutes.**
The trip to Bali for [Institute of Code](http://www.instituteofcode.com/){:target="_blank"} is coming up next month, and I don't feel ready for it at all. I don't have a trip sponsor yet, and my requests to see prior session portfolios have been unanswered. In an effort to get my brain in coding mode, I am committing to completing [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/){:target="_blank"} modules at least six of the seven days of the week in January.

**Draw daily.**
Right before the new year, I learned of Lisa Congdon's [31 Things to Draw daily challenge](https://www.creativebug.com/classseries/single/daily-drawing-challenge){:target="_blank"} on Creative Bug. Some of the things we've tackled in the first week and half: roses, cats, brooms, leaves, trees, birds. I'm posting them on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/slightlydelightful/){:target="_blank"}!

**Get 600+ Misfit points.**
Towards the end of 2015, I started using the Misfit fitness tracker. 600 points represents a life of low activity. I've been reaching my goal by playing Just Dance 2015 since I spend most of my day at a desk in front of a computer.

**Bed by midnight.**
It's pretty self-explanatory. I'd love to get in bed by midnight. I've always been a night owl, but I'd like to make my mornings more productive, so the first step is getting to bed earlier.

I've been tracking these four goals with my [Commit30](http://commit30.com/){:target="_blank"} planner. There's an additional goal/limitation I've placed on both Ryan and myself:

**No buying booze when out and about.**
Saving money is high up there on my list for 2016. One of the areas I found that we spend quite a bit on is alcohol. It adds up, especially if we are grabbing dinner or drinks with friends. This month, when we're out and about, we are sticking to only paying for non-alcoholic beverages. We also have plenty of beer and wine at home that we can work on instead.
