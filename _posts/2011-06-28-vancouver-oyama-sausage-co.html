<p>When <a href="http://linda.curious-notions.net" target="_blank">Linda</a> tweeted me about visiting Vancouver, I immediately threw together a list of recommendations. Knowing that she is as omnivorous as I am, I more or less screamed "<a href="http://www.oyamasausage.ca/" target="_blank">OYAMA SAUSAGE CO</a>!" at her via email. Oyama Sausage Co. on Granville Island was suggested to us when there was mention of potentially checking out <a href="http://www.salttastingroom.com/" target="_blank">Salt Tasting Room</a> in Gastown, a fairly well-received spot serving pairings of meats, cheeses, and wine. Once we were able to locate them inside <a href="http://www.granvilleisland.com/public-market" target="_blank">Granville Island Public Market</a>, I could see why! </p>
<p>As usual, I was so busy soaking in all the food that I didn't grab a photo of the surroundings. </p>

Ryan wanted to pick up some sausages, but since we were in a hotel with just a fridge for the first few nights, we opted for a pate, salami, and cheese picnic that would keep and wouldn't require any prep. </p>
<p>Stephanie, an Oyama trainee, was incredibly patient as we hummed and hawed over our choices. With just two stomachs and only one picnic lunch in mind, we couldn't pick up a little of everything. With the clock ticking [They close at 7, and we were there at half past 6], we finally narrowed it down. She kindly and quickly sliced, wrapped, and labeled our selection. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5183/5873668188_96bbdc54c0_b.jpg" alt="Oyama Sausage Co - Our Goods" /></p></p>
<blockquote><p>Garlic head cheese<br />
Three P&acirc;t&eacute;s - Duck Mousse Divine,Terrine Chanterelles, Belgian Truffle<br />
Two Salamis - Bisou Salami, Yodler Salami<br />
Two Cheeses.</blockquote><br />
All for less than $23! </p>
<p>Paired with some chips, this became our picnic lunch during our Capilano Bridge/Grouse Mountain outing the next day. To be honest, we only got through about 1/3 of our <a href="http://www.oyamasausage.ca/" target="_blank">Oyama</a> purchase during lunch. The rest, paired with crackers, ended up filling our bellies later in the trip. </p>

Clearly, our eyes were larger than our stomach!</p>
