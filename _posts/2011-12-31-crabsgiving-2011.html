Ryan and I <strong>love</strong> Dungeness crab season and enjoy sharing that with our friends. </p>
<p>Over the course of four evenings, 50+ crabs were either served freshly steamed or in some crabby dish. It isn't a crabby party without a menu highlighting the star of the show, so Ryan threw one together. </p>
<p>A few ingredients were changed over the course of four nights, so that's why there are some manual edits.</p>
<p>Since we used only live crabs, that meant taking the meat out of a LOT of crabs the night before each party. We wanted to make sure all of our dishes were full of crabby goodness. There's no canned crab meat in this kitchen! I think Ryan's rate is three crabs in an hour. </p>

I will be posting the recipe in the new year. Coming in as a close second, I'd say the crab rangoon, but those required more time to make. When I started hearing Trader Joe's commercial about their frozen crab rangoon, my heart sank. All that work for nothing! I haven't tried theirs yet, but I still think homemade is the way to go. </p>
