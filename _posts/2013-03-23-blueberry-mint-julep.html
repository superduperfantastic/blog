<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png" alt="Saturday Swig" class="alignleft" />While I did not win the <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/foods-from-chile-a-delightful-substitute/20023/" title="Foods from Chile ~ A Delightful Substitute">trip to Chile</a>, all finalists <em>did</em> receive a bag full of Chilean goodies. One of those items - 100% Pure Blueberry Juice from <a href="http://tamayagourmet.com/blueberry_juice.htm" title="Tamaya Gourmet - Blueberry Juice" target="_blank">Tamaya Gourmet</a>. After a quick search online for ideas on a cocktail to try with blueberries or blueberry juice, I decided on doing my own version of a mint julep. While it is a bit strong for my tastes, I present to you this week's <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/" title="Saturday Swig" target="_blank">Saturday Swig</a> - a blueberry mint julep!</p>

<blockquote><p>Peppermint, muddled<br />
Bourbon<br />
Blueberry Juice<br />
Agave Nectar (to taste)<br />
Ice for the shaking</blockquote><br />
As always, the measurements and the Bourbon used are too taste. </p>
<p>For two drinks, I ended up using a lot of the blueberry juice (see photo below) and adding agave because the bourbon was overpowering. A different and more subtle brand might work better for something like this. Also, I think that using blueberry puree might have been a better choice to emphasize the blueberry in the drink. </p>

I'm not a whiskey drinker YET. I think my problem might be my tendency to want to smell everything as I'm drinking. Once the scent hits my nostrils, the intensity overwhelms me. I once attended a Bourbon tasting and only got through a tiny sip of less than a handful. There were more than a handful to try, of course. I'm slowly trying to acquaint my taste buds with the flavor. Since the tasting, I've ordered an occasional bourbon-based cocktail now and again. On Friday, Ryan's coworkers did an Old Fashioned night, which I willingly participated in. It may one day grow on me... or not. It's hard to say. Your tastebuds change over time anyway.</p>
<p>No complaints from my two taste testers who like strong drinks like this though!</p>
