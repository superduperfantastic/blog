Hello. You may know me already, but I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm that person who shows up in many of Tinna's posts. I've already [posted on this blog](/how-to-drive-around-iceland-in-ev/), but if you went by that criteria you would only know me as the person who's interested in electric vehicles and Iceland. Rather than bore you with a self-important bio written in the third-person, instead I'll give you three things that define me.

**1. I've already had 3 different careers**

I guess those millennials can't make up their minds! In reality my career shifts have been dictated by both uncertain terms and being opportunistic. It started in college, studying and working Broadcasting/Advertising/Mass Media. Few opportunities awaited me out of college (this was 2007!) and I eventually found footing in video games. Starting as a QA tester and going into 3D art. A worsening economy and an average portfolio necessitated another change, landing me in customer support at Disqus (yes the comment system below!). I was finally able to build up my skills to become a software engineer, which I continue today.

**2. People know me as someone who loves fishing**

This is true, I do love fishing. A stable job and dog have made it hard to do often, but there's nothing like being out alone with the wind in your hair and the taste of salt on your tongue. What most people don't know is that I had never cared about fishing until Tinna took me on my first real fishing trip for my birthday. Most of my fishing now is done on a couple yearly trips, and speculating which seasonal delights the [Seaforager](https://www.seaforager.com/) will collect for us.

**3. I always have a project**

I've had many different hobbies throughout my life, from the aforementioned fishing to building apps to learning 3D modeling. You can be assured that at any given moment there's something I'm giving all of my creative energy to. Right now, it's a VR game that wouldn't have been possible if I hadn't learned some of these things before. Now I've got to get back to it!
