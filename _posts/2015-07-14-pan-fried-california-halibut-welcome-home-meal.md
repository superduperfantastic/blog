_Overlooking Crater Lake_

Over the Fourth of July weekend, Ryan and I took a road trip through Oregon in a rented [Jucy](http://jucyrentals.com/) campervan. We were on the road for five days, making stops in Crater Lake, Bend and Portland. We slept in the van at rest stops, campgrounds, and even a motel (just for one night).

We pre-cut vegetables before hitting the road, so we were eating the same ones morning and night. The onions, shallots, bell peppers and mushrooms made appearances at breakfast and dinner, while the cheese from our lunchtime grilled cheeses also showed up at breakfast to top off our eggs.

The few meals we "cheated" on and didn't cook were dinners at a Thai restaurant (once in Bend and once in Redding) and a home-cooked Puerto Rican meal at Ryan's cousin's house.

Our [Sea Forager](http://seaforager.com/) shipment of the week were slabs of California halibut, or as Ryan and I like to call it, "Calibut."

We decided to keep it fairly simple by pan frying the halibut in olive oil. For the thickness of our filets, we gave each side about five minutes. We rounded out the meal with broccoli and couscous with grilled corn on the side and a glass of [2014 Cultivar Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc](http://www.cultivarwine.com/?method=products.productDrilldown&productID=56B5B87A-B4B9-4E05-BB1C-16AD1DDA178D&originalMarketingURL=product/2014-Cultivar-Napa-Valley-Sauvignon-Blanc).

We were recently invited to join [Cultivar Wine's](http://www.cultivarwine.com/) Blogger club. We gladly accepted, and our first shipment this quarter included bottles of [2014 Cultivar Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc](http://www.cultivarwine.com/?method=products.productDrilldown&productID=56B5B87A-B4B9-4E05-BB1C-16AD1DDA178D&originalMarketingURL=product/2014-Cultivar-Napa-Valley-Sauvignon-Blanc) and [2013 Cultivar Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon](http://www.cultivarwine.com/product/2013-Napa-Valley-Cabernet-Sauvignon?pageID=1E70E1D6-EE0B-BCA9-CD80-4DFD0C6DEFC0&sortBy=DisplayOrder&maxRows=16&).

As described in the tasting notes, this Sauvignon Blanc is aromatic with notes of jasmine, roses, and subtle citrus, which open to passionfruit and melon. As for flavor, the wine has bright passionfruit and citrus notes and pairs well with grilled fish and chicken.

Our pan-fried "Calibut" was no exception, and the glass of Sauvignon Blanc really made this homecooked meal even more special after our roadtrip.
