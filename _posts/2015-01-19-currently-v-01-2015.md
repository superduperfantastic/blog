**Loving** the quality time spent with friends and family so far. With all the holiday festivities, we were out of the house quite a bit. These past few weekends, Ryan and I have consistently taken Fresca out to fun places to explore and play with her friends.

**Loathing** how much money I ended up spending towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year. In an effort to spend less, we have been cooking at home more. At the beginning of the weekend, I made lasagna. It ended up being pretty tasty, even if it looked a bit disheveled!

**Watching** very little on television these days, but reading a lot instead. I set my [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/superduperfantastic "Goodreads"){:target="_blank"} goal to 26 books for this year, and I'm already at 42% of my goal. Nobody ever defined what books I had to read in order to reach this goal, so there have been quite a few young adult fantasy series I've been going through.

**Feeling** pretty content with how this year has started off and definitely cannot believe that we're more than halfway through the first month of the year.

**Planning** on making the most of 2015! One of my main goals is to do all the fun things without stretching myself too thin. In the past few years, it's been pretty easy to fill up the calendar with everything under the sun. Getting over my FOMO is the theme of the year. Quality over quantity!

**Working** on ridding the house of clutter and into the shape we'd like it to be in. Slowly and surely, we're reorganizing the house. Ryan spent a weekend removing all the weeds (there were SO MANY) in the backyard. He put in a patch of fake grass and gravel, and Fresca has taken to it quickly. YAY! It's just one project of many on our list.

**Wishing** and hoping for the blog inspiration to continue. I re-implemented my editorial calendar and have a few posts planned for the rest of the month.

**Looking forward to** The Brewing Network's [Winter Brews Fest](http://bnbrewfest.com/ "Winter Brews Fest"){:target="_blank"} this Saturday!
