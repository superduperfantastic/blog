<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png" alt="Saturday Swig" class="alignleft" />An evening of dancing it up in the Fairmont's Swig Suite in fancy gowns marked the 83rd Annual Ball for the <a href="http://sfspinsters.com/" title="Spinsters of San Francisco" target="_blank">Spinsters of San Francisco</a> this past weekend. The theme this year - Through the Looking Glass. Annual Ball is the one night in the year where I put on my fancy pants and get my hair and nails done, so that I can hang out where President John F. Kennedy, Prince Charles, Mikhail Gorbachev, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Hussein of Jordan [just to name a few!] have stayed. </p>

The decor of the Swig Suite is absolutely gorgeous, and the view is stunning! We were lucky enough to have perfect weather for the evening, and I was reminded all night of how much I love this city.</p>

This week's <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/" title="Saturday Swig">Saturday Swig</a> are these incredibly cute party favors - bottles of absinthe with little hand-stamped "Drink Me" tags. </p>

So very Alice in Wonderland! Actually all of the party decor fit the theme.</p>

Though I might have posed with these absinthe bottles, I didn't take a sip as the tags instructed. It would've been dangerous! Instead, I took a few bottles home because someone had mentioned to me about making ice cream. Perhaps <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2009/05/absinthe-ice-cream/" title="Absinthe Ice Cream" target="_blank">this recipe</a> from David Lebovitz? </p>
<p><strong>Have you tried absinthe before?</strong></p>
