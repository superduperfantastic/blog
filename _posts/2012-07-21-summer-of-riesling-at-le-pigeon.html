<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png" alt="Saturday Swig" class="alignleft" />In keeping with the discussion of <a href="http://www.lepigeon.com/" title="Le Pigeon" target="_blank">Le Pigeon</a> from yesterday, this weekend's Saturday Swig is the wine flight that I ordered with <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/le-pigeon-foie-all-the-courses/17104/" title="Le Pigeon - Foie all the courses">the meal</a>. It's a Riesling flight of the same grapes from the same winery in the Umpqua Valley, <a href="http://brandborgwine.com/" target="_blank">Brandborg Winery</a>, only they're from different vintages. From left to right [and from memory, so hopefully I am correct]: 2008, 2003, 2002.</p>
<p>I was quite surprised at how dry they all were. None of them were the usual sweet Riesling that I was accustomed to. I did notice that the three were quite different from each other in both the nose and the taste. </p>

All so delicious for different reasons!</p>
