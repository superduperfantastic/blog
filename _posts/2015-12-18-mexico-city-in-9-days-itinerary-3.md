### DAY FOUR in Mexico City - Centro Historico with Journeys Beyond the Surface ###

We woke up to an email from [Journeys Beyond the Surface](http://travelmexicocity.com.mx/){:target="_blank"}. Our tour guide fell ill, and our full day tour was cancelled. Thankfully, she gave us two other options - a full refund of the deposit *and* crashing a tour that someone else had with another guide for the same area for half a day or no tour at all. The choice seemed pretty obvious, so we crashed someone else's tour! 

We quickly hopped into an Uber to Centro Historico to catch up to our guide and new tour buddy. While I normally don't take tours, I'm a huge proponent for taking one or two in Mexico City. You really learn so much about the history and context of all that you're seeing. Spots visited on the tour: Metropolitan Cathedral, Palacio Nacional (Diego Rivera murals), Palacio de Bellas Artes, Palacio Postal, Plaza Manuel Tolsa, Sanborns de los Azulejos.

Unfortunately since we had an abrupt start to our morning, we didn't get the chance to grab breakfast. Our stomachs were grumbling the entire time. When the Centro Historico portion of the tour wrapped, we went on our way to find food!

Mercado de San Juan was walking distance away, so we headed over there. Unfortunately, we made the mistake of not sitting down for meat and cheeses, which the market is well-known for. Instead we picked a stand where there appeared to be a set menu. The man behind the counter asked if we wanted soup, so we took the soup and ate it. He then offered us rice, except it was just rice. It didn't appear to come with anything, and we were not sure how to get a plate like the other people sitting at the same stand. So much confusion! 

Since your full day tour became a half day tour, take out the list of recommendations from <a href="http://travelmexicocity.com.mx/" target="_blank">Journeys Beyond the Surface</a>. Walk to nearby graffiti art for photos.

Stop in at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/al-andar-m%C3%A9xico-3" target="_blank">Al Andar</a> for drinks and a snack while the rain passes. Take note to come back again since this spot is known for mezcal. Take an Uber back to the Airbnb once the rain has stopped.

Decide to have sushi at <a href="http://toritori.com.mx/" target="_blank">Tori Tori</a> at Temistocles #61 in Polanco since the specific location was on your Airbnb host's list of recommendations. Walk to dinner. Admire the unique restaurant decor and design before asking to sit at the sushi counter. Spend the next few minutes wondering if you'll ever get a menu. Realize you should have taken a table. Finally ask the sushi chef if there is a menu, and he hands you a giant wooden menu that is much too heavy to hold on your own. 

Sigh with relief when you see that the menu, while in Spanish, has Japanese that you understand and can order from without asking questions. Order your food. Devour it!

On the way back to the Airbnb, stop in at Helados Santa Clara for dessert. It's been a day of confusing dining in Mexico City.

### DAY FIVE in Mexico City - Museums / Graffiti Art ###

Ride an Ecobici to breakfast at <a href="http://catamundi.com/#_=_" target="_blank">Catamundi</a>, another Airbnb host recommendation. Sit outside because the weather is lovely. Take photos of your meal because you've just encountered the most beautiful avocado toast. It will be your most liked <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9u2F6mOBmZ/?taken-by=superduperfantastic" target="_blank">Instagram photo</a> ever. No exaggeration.

Head over to <a href="http://mna.inah.gob.mx/index.html" target="_blank">Museo Nacional de Antropologia</a>. Admire the building. Look at the exhibits. 

Your hunger and an Ecobici bring you to [Mercado Roma](http://mercadoroma.com/){:target="_blank"}. Grab a juice upstairs, sit and people watch. Order some *tlacoyos* at one of the stands because you learned what they were on your <a href="http://eatmexico.com/" target="_blank">Eat Mexico</a> tour earlier this trip. Sample some fancy ice cream bars.

Walk to [Museo del Juguete Antiguo Mexico](http://museodeljuguete.mx/){:target="_blank"} (MUJAM), even though biking would have been much faster. Wander around the property taking photos of some of the graffiti art. Walk into the store and look around until someone tells you that the museum entrance is actually up a dark stairway.

Go up the dark stairway. Ring the doorbell. Spend the next few hours among old toys and wonderful graffiti art spread across many floors. But first, meet the man/collector behind it all, Roberto Shimizu. Learn about how and why he started collecting. Explore the museum. Take too many photos.

Ask to see the rooftop because that was the pro tip you were given. Watch the sun set from the rooftop. Take too many photos.

Fill out a comment card one minute before the museum closes.

Recall seeing some Korean restaurants on some of your Uber rides and look up Peque&ntilde;o Se&uacute;l, Koreatown in Mexico City. Take an Uber to a specific restaurant in Koreatown. Look for the restaurant unsuccessfully. Walk around the corner and eat dinner at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mapo-Gal-Bi/172045342930531?rf=436111446446597" target="_blank">Ma Po Gal Bi</a>. Gorge on delicious Korean food and drink too much soju.

>### Mexico City - Real Talk ###
>- If you are riding <a href="https://www.ecobici.df.gob.mx/en" target="_blank">Ecobicis</a>, use the app to find parking because people use these bikes to commute and some racks are more full than others. 
>-Eat at <a href="http://catamundi.com/#_=_" target="_blank">Catamundi</a> or pick something up for later. The market inside looks amazing!
>- Go to <a href="http://mercadoroma.com/" target="_blank">Mercado Roma</a>, even for a snack or a juice. It's a beautiful spot.
>- MUJAM came recommended by <a href="http://travelmexicocity.com.mx/" target="_blank">Journeys Beyond the Surface</a>, again for graffiti art. The toys, graffiti art, and meeting the owner were the highlight of our trip. Go see it if you have a few hours to spare. Ask to see the rooftop!
>- <a href="http://mna.inah.gob.mx/index.html" target="_blank">Museo Nacional de Antropologia</a> is the most visited museum in Mexico and recommended by most of our friends who have been to Mexico City. The tours we did earlier in our trip were incredibly helpful in giving a context to what we were seeing in the exhibits.
>- More time can be dedicated to the museums in Centro Historico. It's on our list for the next time!
