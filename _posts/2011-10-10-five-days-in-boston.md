Oh Boston, you've been on my list of places to visit for quite some time, and finally I can cross you off the list! Ryan and I took a few extra days to make it an extra long weekend. Like our trip to Chicago, we used [AirBnB](http://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=97zb7a3fzz5 "AirBnB"){:target="_blank"} for accommodations. This time, our host was around and basically helped us hit the ground running each day with a hearty breakfast. Even with only a five day-stay, we bought [7-day MBTA passes](http://mbta.com/fares_and_passes/passes/){:target="_blank"} for $15 each. Absolutely worth it.

**Friday**
- Early arrival at Boston Logan International Airport.  
- Baked goodies at [Flour Bakery & Cafe](http://flourbakery.com/ "Flour Bakery and Cafe"){:target="_blank"} in the South End after reading about it on Linda's [food blog](http://girleatsworld.curious-notions.net/){:target="_blank"}.  
- Downtown Boston tour with [Stray Boots](http://www.strayboots.com/ "Stray Boots"){:target="_blank"}. Towards the end of the tour, we were hungry and tired, so the clues seemed harder and harder.  
- Tater tot/beer break at [Stoddard's Fine Food & Ale](http://stoddardsfoodandale.com/ "Stoddard's Fine Food & Ale"){:target="_blank"}.  
- A much needed nap! We didn't get much sleep on our red-eye.  
- Dinner at [Rino's Place](http://www.rinosplace.com/){:target="_blank"} - YUM.

**Monday**  
- Early morning at South Station, waiting for our Megabus to Vermont. No such luck.  
- Visiting the [Adams National Historic Park](http://www.nps.gov/adam/index.htm "Adams National Historic Park"){:target="_blank"} in Quincy instead.  
- Not feeling so great. Might have been the mix and match of Boloco or the leftovers for breakfast in the morning. Trying to recover by having lunch at [Fat Cat](http://fatcatrestaurant.com/ "Fat Cat Restaurant"){:target="_blank"}.  
- Charlestown Navy Yard to see the [USS Constitution](http://www.history.navy.mil/ussconstitution/ "USS Constitution"){:target="_blank"} and then the [USS Cassin Young](http://www.nps.gov/bost/historyculture/usscassinyoung.htm "USS Cassin Young"){:target="_blank"}.

- Dinner at[Zenna Noodle Bar](http://www.zennanoodle.com/ "Zenna Noodle Bar"){:target="_blank"} in Coolidge Corner where some lady walks in, spills my Thai Iced Tea on me, and then leaves. What a baffling experience!  
- Walking around in the rain because our transit pass doesn't work for some reason.

**Tuesday**
- Hunting down the [African American Heritage Trail](http://www.nps.gov/boaf/index.htm "Boston African American Heritage Site"){:target="_blank"} stamp. You might have figured out by now that I'm one of those people with the [National Parks Passport](http://www.eparks.com/store/product/22515/*Passport-To-Your-National-Parks*/ "National Parks Passport"){:target="_blank"} who go to as many national parks collecting stamps.  
- Cambridge - [Alive & Kicking Lobsters](http://www.yelp.com/biz/alive-and-kicking-lobsters-cambridge "Alive and Kicking Lobsters"){:target="_blank"} - with [Jo](http://www.reelpersona.com/ "Reel Persona"){:target="_blank"} and the Harvard Art Museum.
