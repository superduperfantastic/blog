When a coworker heard that we were heading to Iceland, she immediately recommended [The Fish Market](http://www.fiskmarkadurinn.is/){:target="_blank"} if we were to spend any time in Reyjkavik. With the craziness of our roadtrip around the country, the only time that worked for us would be our first night in Iceland. 

Our flight arrived mid-day, and after we picked up our rental car, we made our way into town. Since it was somewhat of an overnight flight and we were supposed to have rested on the plane, our main goal for the day was to stay awake. If we were to start our drive bright and early in the morning, we would have to stay up as long as possible in order to get our internal clocks all caught up.

## Geranium - Kitchen

Before dessert, we were invited to the kitchen for a palate cleanser - _Tea from Vegetables, Beech Leaves & Pine_. We chitchatted with the international team and just took it all in. It was neat to see a bit of the action.

Earlier in the year, I had been tested for allergies, and pretty much every tree pollen caused my back to itch. The trip confirmed that I am definitely allergic to trees because after each meal that I consumed pine, I'd get a little bit itchy.

No pain, no gain! The meal at Geranium was definitely one of _many_ highlights from our trip.
