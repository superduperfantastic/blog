This was the year of insanity at [Russian River Brewing Co.](http://www.russianriverbrewing.com/){:target="_blank"} in downtown Santa Rosa. Who in their right mind waits five hours in line for beer?! Guilty as charged **right here** AND the fine folks pictured above. The wait was long, but we were prepared. Each of us stood in line with reading material, so our hours would not go to complete waste. We arrived about half an hour later than [last year](http://superduperfantastic.com/in-line-for-the-younger-sour-beer/7222/ "In Line for the Younger + Sour Beer!"){:target="_blank"}, and on the first full day of release, and it made all the difference. The line was insane. At least we weren't the only crazies there, and we were occupied throughout the wait!

After the obligatory Pliny the Youngers, I ordered my usual - a sampling of sour beers. They really do make some of the best I've ever had.

Of course, we stuffed ourselves with pizza and beer bites once we got our table and beer.

Good brews, good eats, and good times! Couldn't have asked for a better weekend. I also got through about half of [The Time Traveler's Wife](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Wife-Audrey-Niffenegger/dp/0547119798/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330310211&sr=8-1 "The Time Traveler's Wife"){:target="_blank"} while we were in line.

**What have you waited in a LONG LINE for [but was totally worth it]?**
