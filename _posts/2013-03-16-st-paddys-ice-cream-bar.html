  content: I second the recommendation for their egg salad sandwich! I tried their
    egg nog once (it might be a seasonal thing; I'm not sure) and it was interesting
    b/c it had actual raw egg and brandy in it.

For this week's <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/" title="Saturday Swig" target="_blank">Saturday Swig</a>, we hopped on over to <a href="http://theicecreambarsf.com/" title="The Ice Cream Bar" target="_blank">The Ice Cream Bar</a> in San Francisco's Cole Valley neighborhood. For the weekend (March 14 to March 17), they have a special St. Paddy's menu! In addition to a special ice cream flavor (Guinness Brown Bread), the menu includes:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8373/8565160899_afebb8c03f_n.jpg" alt="The Ice Cream Bar" class="alignleft" /><strong>The Dublin Honey Ice Cream Float : </strong>Guinness stout, caramelized honey ice cream, and Valrhona chocolate syrup, topped with a float of Graham's 10 year old tawny port</p>
<p><strong>Potato Leek Soup</strong> served with house made Irish brown bread</p>
<p><strong>Corned Beef Plate :</strong> House cured corned beef served with roasted potatoes, carrots, and cabbage</p>
<p>A little over a year old, it's no ordinary ice cream shop. The Ice Cream Bar is a soda fountain and ice cream parlor inspired by the soda fountains of the 1930s. Open daily from noon to 10pm, it serves up an ever-changing selection of ice cream and some creative fountain drinks made of homemade extracts, as well as a few savory items. With all the tinctures on the wall and lined up along the counter, it feels like you're waiting for an apothecary's concoction.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8565252783_ac7819bb01_c.jpg" alt="The Ice Cream Bar" /></p><br />
Last summer, The Ice Cream Bar's root beer float was included in Eater SF's list of <a href="http://sf.eater.com/archives/2012/08/21/iconic_drinks.php" target="_blank">San Francisco's 19 Most Iconic Drinks</a>. Having tried the root beer float on a prior visit, I decided to try something else on the menu that sounded interesting - <em>A Stalk in the Park</em> (celery seed extract, fountain syrup, cream, lactart, soda, celery stalk, and fresh mint). The combination of lactart, soda, cream and mint gave it almost a kumquat flavor. Very unique and delicious! </p>
<p>If parking in the neighborhood was a lot easier <em>and</em> if I wasn't saving up for our Copenhagen trip, you would find me at <a href="http://theicecreambarsf.com/" title="The Ice Cream Bar" target="_blank">The Ice Cream Bar</a> often. With the variety of drinks, I could probably do a <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/" title="Saturday Swig">Saturday Swig</a> here week after week. It's the kind of place you wouldn't mind turning into your local watering hole. They've got a great space, delicious food and desserts, and if you're up for it, boozy desserts!</p>
