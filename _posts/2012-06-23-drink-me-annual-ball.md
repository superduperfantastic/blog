![Saturday Swig](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png){:.left} An evening of dancing it up in the Fairmont's Swig Suite in fancy gowns marked the 83rd Annual Ball for the [Spinsters of San Francisco](http://sfspinsters.com/ "Spinsters of San Francisco"){:target="_blank"} this past weekend. The theme this year - Through the Looking Glass. Annual Ball is the one night in the year where I put on my fancy pants and get my hair and nails done, so that I can hang out where President John F. Kennedy, Prince Charles, Mikhail Gorbachev, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Hussein of Jordan [just to name a few!] have stayed.

The decor of the Swig Suite is absolutely gorgeous, and the view is stunning! We were lucky enough to have perfect weather for the evening, and I was reminded all night of how much I love this city.

This week's [Saturday Swig](http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/ "Saturday Swig"){:target="_blank"} are these incredibly cute party favors - bottles of absinthe with little hand-stamped "Drink Me" tags.

So very Alice in Wonderland! Actually all of the party decor fit the theme.

Though I might have posed with these absinthe bottles, I didn't take a sip as the tags instructed. It would've been dangerous! Instead, I took a few bottles home because someone had mentioned to me about making ice cream. Perhaps [this recipe](http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2009/05/absinthe-ice-cream/ "Absinthe Ice Cream"){:target="_blank"} from David Lebovitz?

**Have you tried absinthe before?**
