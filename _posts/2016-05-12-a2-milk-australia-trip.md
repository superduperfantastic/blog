_This post was sponsored by a2 Milk® as part of an Ambassador Program for Influence Central. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review._ 

Remember that [a2 Milk ®](https://a2milk.com/){:target="_blank"} I wrote about not that long ago? I'm still drinking it!

As part of their ambassador program, it has been interesting to learn about a2 Milk ® and note any changes that come from drinking it, rather than regular cows milk. While I've grown up drinking milk, my body doesn't quite handle dairy in the same way as it used to. It doesn't come as a surprise since 1 in 4 Americans experiences discomfort after drinking milk. 

![a2 Milk](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7062/27163724151_a01673b72d.jpg){:.left} The A1 protein is the culprit behind _Post-Dairy Digestive Discomfort_ and currently in all conventional and organic milks on the U.S. market. a2 Milk ® comes from specially selected cows, 'the way mother nature intended.' No complaints here when it comes to experiencing fewer tummy rumbles for A1 protein sensitivity! a2 Milk® is pure farm-fresh milk that is rich in protein, calcium and potassium. Fun fact: a2 Milk® contains approximately 6x the amount of calcium as soy beverages, approximately 8x the protein of almond beverages and approximately 6x the potassium levels of rice beverages. Aside from the nutritional benefits, I've never been a huge fan of the flavors of soy or almond milk. Based on what I've consumed in the last few months, a2 Milk ® tastes like regular milk. I don't see why I _wouldn't_ switch to a2 Milk ®, knowing all of that. I've also had the pleasure of sharing that knowledge with friends, family and strangers. Just the other night, a group of us were making smores by heat lamp and making hot cocoa. Some of the gals felt that their "lactose intolerance" would keep them from enjoying the hot cocoa, but luckily I had some a2 Milk ® handy. They were skeptical at first, but I think I might have a few converts. Now they (and YOU too!) can try it for **FREE** and see the difference yourself. Check out all the information on this receipt-redemption offer at [trya2milk.com](http://trya2milk.com/){:target="_blank"}! While you're there, you can also enter for your chance to **win a trip to Australia**, courtesy of The a2 Milk Company™! Whether you are lactose-intolerant or not, a2 Milk® is worth a try. A trip to Australia doesn't hurt either.
