Before we would make the trek up to the North Shore, we spent the morning doing what we know best - eating and drinking. First stop: [Glazers Coffee](http://www.glazerscoffee.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I wouldn't normally take photos of my coffee [okay, maybe I would], but how can one resist when there's coffee art?

And then the cutest of them all - this was my sister's white mocha.

After our caffeine fix, we set out to look for breakfast items. Enter [Liliha Bakery](http://lilihabakeryhawaii.com/){:target="_blank"} and their Coco Puffs [cream puffs].

I'm just glad that we didn't travel all this way to have Cocoa Puffs, the cereal. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw "Coco Puffs" on the list of eats. We also ordered a few other baked goods since the Coco Puffs were a bit much for breakfast. They have a diner/lunch counter at Liliha, but there was a wait.

Hot dog bun and a tuna/ham bun. Sounds weird, but they actually tasted pretty good. I'm going to pause for a moment before continuing on about Sunday!
