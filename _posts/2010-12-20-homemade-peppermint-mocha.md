If I had to choose my favorite thing about the holidays, it would be the peppermint overload of the season! Each year, I would wait until December to order peppermint white mochas from Starbucks. They're just the right amount of sweetness, minty goodness, and coffee for the occasional coffee drinker that I am. They will make them year-round if you just ask, but I prefer to stick with my once-a-year indulgence.

This year, however, I've yet to visit Starbucks for this minty creation because:

1) One week a year, my building has a coffee cart come in to serve free drinks.  
2) We're making our own peppermint mochas at home!

**Homemade Peppermint Mocha**

> **Ingredients:**  
> - Coffee  
> - Peppermint bark

> - Whipped cream

> **What To Do:**
> 
> 1) Prepare your coffee. We used a French press, but it doesn't really matter as long as it is HOT enough to melt the chocolate.
> 
> 2) Prepare your sweetener/creamer. We combined condensed milk and whole milk to desired sweetness.
> 
> 3) Put the peppermint bark and sweetener/creamer into your mug.

> 4) Pour hot coffee into the mug, stirring to dissolve everything!
> 
> 5) Top with whipped cream and enjoy!

Absolutely delicious! :) I purchased the 2-lb. box of peppermint bark from Costco not too long ago. It's $10 and more peppermint bark than we'd ever think we'd need/use! It's a good thing we put them in our coffee now.

Aside from our delicious peppermint mochas, **what should we use the peppermint bark for?**
