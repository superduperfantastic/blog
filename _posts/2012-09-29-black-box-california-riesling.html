In an effort to drop the hefty price tag of acclaimed wines, <a href="http://www.blackboxwines.com/" title="Black Box Wines" target="_blank">Black Box Wines</a> ditched the bottle in 2003 and became "the first U.S. vintner to offer super-premium, appellation-specific, vintage-dated wines in a box." The first to hit this blog? A winner of a gold medal in the 2012 San Francisco International Wine Competition - the <a href="http://www.blackboxwines.com/riesling.html" title="Black Box California Riesling" target="_blank">2011 Black Box California Riesling</a>! </p>

Each box holds the equivalent of <strong>four</strong> bottles of wine. It stays fresh for four weeks after opening, and the best part - it's <strong>half</strong> the carbon footprint of glass bottles. </p>
<p>First, I must admit that I opened the box incorrectly because I didn't see the directions! The directions are on the bottom of each box, so that's probably how I missed them the first time around. See, I started out breaking open the box from the top... Oops!</p>

Four bottles of wine can be a lot for one person in one sitting. I am always up for sharing, so I brought this box on an overnight trip to Santa Cruz with the girls. </p>

After spending a few hours down by the water, we were ready to wind down with a bit of wine at the house. Since it was quite warm out, the chilled Riesling was absolutely refreshing! </p>
<p>Upon first sniff, we definitely caught a lot of citrus [tangerines!] and peach. The wine smelled a lot sweeter than it actually tasted [at least to me], but it is considered off-dry. It's got a light body and light acidity, so it's a pleasant fruity wine for a hot day. </p>
<p>The four bottles in the one box somehow survived the night away, and upon returning home, I wanted to enjoy it with a home cooked meal. The suggested pairings in the notes were Thai food, such as chicken satay, and grilled halibut. They were taken into consideration, and Ryan ended up making a sweeter fried chicken with Kara-Age Soy-Ginger Seasoned Coating Mix. </p>

For the record, we thought that the pairing worked!</p>
