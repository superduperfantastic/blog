![Saturday Swig](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png){:.left} This week's [Saturday Swig](http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/ "Saturday Swig"){:target="_blank"}  comes in a box. In an effort to drop the hefty price tag of acclaimed wines, [Black Box Wines](http://www.blackboxwines.com/ "Black Box Wines"){:target="_blank"} ditched the bottle in 2003 and became "the first U.S. vintner to offer super-premium, appellation-specific, vintage-dated wines in a box." The first to hit this blog? A winner of a gold medal in the 2012 San Francisco International Wine Competition - the [2011 Black Box California Riesling](http://www.blackboxwines.com/riesling.html "Black Box California Riesling"){:target="_blank"} !

![Black Box California Riesling](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8455/8017758113_c033befe9e_m.jpg){:.right} Yes, that means there will be more Black Box to come. Each box holds the equivalent of **four** bottles of wine. It stays fresh for four weeks after opening, and the best part - it's **half** the carbon footprint of glass bottles.

First, I must admit that I opened the box incorrectly because I didn't see the directions! The directions are on the bottom of each box, so that's probably how I missed them the first time around. See, I started out breaking open the box from the top... Oops!

### Black Box California Riesling

Four bottles of wine can be a lot for one person in one sitting. I am always up for sharing, so I brought this box on an overnight trip to Santa Cruz with the girls.

After spending a few hours down by the water, we were ready to wind down with a bit of wine at the house. Since it was quite warm out, the chilled Riesling was absolutely refreshing!

Upon first sniff, we definitely caught a lot of citrus [tangerines!] and peach. The wine smelled a lot sweeter than it actually tasted [at least to me], but it is considered off-dry. It's got a light body and light acidity, so it's a pleasant fruity wine for a hot day.

The four bottles in the one box somehow survived the night away, and upon returning home, I wanted to enjoy it with a home cooked meal. The suggested pairings in the notes were Thai food, such as chicken satay, and grilled halibut. They were taken into consideration, and Ryan ended up making a sweeter fried chicken with Kara-Age Soy-Ginger Seasoned Coating Mix.

For the record, we thought that the pairing worked!

**What do you think of boxed wines?**
