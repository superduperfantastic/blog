When [Linda](http://linda.curious-notions.net) tweeted me about visiting Vancouver, I immediately threw together a list of recommendations. Knowing that she is as omnivorous as I am, I more or less screamed "[OYAMA SAUSAGE CO](http://www.oyamasausage.ca/)!" at her via email. Oyama Sausage Co. on Granville Island was suggested to us when there was mention of potentially checking out [Salt Tasting Room](http://www.salttastingroom.com/) in Gastown, a fairly well-received spot serving pairings of meats, cheeses, and wine. Once we were able to locate them inside [Granville Island Public Market](http://www.granvilleisland.com/public-market), I could see why!

As usual, I was so busy soaking in all the food that I didn't grab a photo of the surroundings.

Ryan wanted to pick up some sausages, but since we were in a hotel with just a fridge for the first few nights, we opted for a pate, salami, and cheese picnic that would keep and wouldn't require any prep.

Stephanie, an Oyama trainee, was incredibly patient as we hummed and hawed over our choices. With just two stomachs and only one picnic lunch in mind, we couldn't pick up a little of everything. With the clock ticking [They close at 7, and we were there at half past 6], we finally narrowed it down. She kindly and quickly sliced, wrapped, and labeled our selection.

![Oyama Sausage Co - Our Goods](https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5183/5873668188_96bbdc54c0_b.jpg)

> Garlic head cheese  
> Three Pâtés - Duck Mousse Divine,Terrine Chanterelles, Belgian Truffle  
> Two Salamis - Bisou Salami, Yodler Salami  
> Two Cheeses.

All for less than $23!

Paired with some chips, this became our picnic lunch during our Capilano Bridge/Grouse Mountain outing the next day. To be honest, we only got through about 1/3 of our [Oyama](http://www.oyamasausage.ca/) purchase during lunch. The rest, paired with crackers, ended up filling our bellies later in the trip.

Clearly, our eyes were larger than our stomach!
