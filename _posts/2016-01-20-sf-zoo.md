Ryan and I kicked off the new year with a visit to the SF Zoo. The 100 acres in the southwestern corner of the city is home to over 1,000 exotic, endangered and rescued animals representing more than 250 species. I bought a membership last year, thinking we would visit a few times during the year. It expires at the end of the month, and I've only gone once in the year.<!--more-->

In celebration of Penguin Awareness Day (January 20), here are some photos of the Magellanic penguins at the SF Zoo. It boasts the largest breeding colony of Magellanic penguins in captivity!
