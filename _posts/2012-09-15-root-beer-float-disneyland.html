    beers.

    It's cooling down!
    We're getting in the awkward phrase where it's cool in morning and evening but kind of hot in the middle of the day. I remember it made wardrobe tricky when I was on campus all day.

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7322171030_0166725d1c_o.png" alt="Saturday Swig" class="alignleft" />This week's Saturday Swig is a root beer float! I skipped last week's <a href="http://superduperfantastic.com/tag/saturday-swig/" title="Saturday Swig">Saturday Swig</a> post because I was having way too much fun at Disneyland! <a href="http://donnasaur.us" title="Donnasaur" target="_blank">Donna</a> [new domain!], Ryan and I drove down Friday evening. We spent only one day at the Disneyland parks [no California Adventure this time] because we would have to drive back Sunday. Rather than rushing back, we took our time and a longer route back passing through Santa Barbara - 101 rather than the 5. </p>
<p>With the holiday the weekend before, Disneyland was more relaxing than any other time I've been there. We had quite a bit of time to roam from ride to ride. We made a stop at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horseshoe_Revue#The_Golden_Horseshoe_Revue" title="The Golden Horseshoe Saloon" target="_blank">The Golden Horseshoe Saloon</a> in Frontierland when we spotted a sign for root beer floats! It was between 80 and 90 degrees out, so the break was definitely welcome.</p>
<h3>Root Beer Float Time!</h3></p>

Unfortunately, we made the root beer float break a little on the early side. We missed the shows that you'd normally find at the Golden Horseshoe since we didn't check our schedules until <em>after</em> we'd already devoured the floats and made our way across the park. We'll have to time it better next time!</p>
