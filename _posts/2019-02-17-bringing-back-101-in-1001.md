From January 2012 to October 2014, I began my first 101 in 1001 list. In 2015, I did something similar with a life audit. Another milestone is looming, and so I've decided to revive the 101 in 1001 list / life audit and document my progress. If I were to be more precise about this, I would've started mid January, but in the spirit of self-care, I'll give myself a little more time, I've set the deadline of the list for a few months after turning 40, so I have some time to complete the audit and fine tune my list. 

While I don't have the old list up on the blog anymore, I was able to find a copy of it on my computer. Turns out there were some things I finally achieved WAAYYYY after the fact, and then there were others that I no longer have the desire to complete. 

Over this holiday weekend and likely through the next week or two, I'll go through the exercise of preparing the list of 101 things to work on in the next 1001 days. Super excited to see what makes the list!
